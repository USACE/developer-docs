# Developer Docs

> A collection of best practices, and let's admit it opinions.

At the Remote Sensing, GIS Center of Expertise (RS/GIS) we build lots of technology around geospatial applications.  This site is an attempt at documenting our current development stack and some best practices.  This is a living document and we'll do our best to keep it up to date with our current flow.
